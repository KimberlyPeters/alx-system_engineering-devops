# Command Line For The Win

These are screenshots from my progress in the [CMDCHALLENGE](https://cmdchallenge.com/).

CMD CHALLENGE is a pretty cool game challenging you on Bash skills. Everything is done via the command line and the questions are becoming increasingly complicated. Itâ€™s a good training to improve your command line skills!

This repository contains projects from the command-line challenge:
- The [0-first_9_tasks.jpg](/0-first_9_tasks.jpg) with 9 tasks
- The [1-next_9_tasks.jpg](/1-next_9_tasks.jpg) with 9 tasks
- and The [2-next_9_tasks.jpg](/2-next_9_tasks.jpg) with 9 tasks

I have provided the screenshots in .jpg format
